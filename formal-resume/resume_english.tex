\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hi, I am Kenji Mouri. My legal name is Qi Lu which is used only when offline. MouriNaruto, Mouri\_Naruto and Mouri are my typical usernames.
  \item I am interested in writing the most compact implementations by using the least syntaxes and third-party libraries. Also, I am desired to make more friends which can talk something about technology.
  \item I have created and maintained several open-source projects mostly written in C/C++ at night since 2014.
  \item I am also a proud Microsoft MVP with Developer Technologies and Windows Development award categories.
  \item I hope my next job can do something about system or bare-metal related software development and maintenance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Education}

\datedline{\textbf{Changshu Institute of Technology}, China}{Sep 2016 -- Jul 2020}
  Bachelor of Engineering, Automotive Service Engineering. I also have passed the CET-6 at this period.

\section{Skills}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I'm not limited to any specific programming language, but I usually use C/C++ and C\#. I can adapt to any tools under Windows and Linux, but I prefer Visual Studio under Windows.
  \item I have focused on Windows Development with Win32 API, COM (ATL and WTL) and WinRT (C++/WinRT) since 2014, which I started to participate in the Chuyu Team's next generation (at that time) third-party Windows servicing tool which is called DISM++ today.
  \item I love doing some bare-metal development with Visual Studio under Windows. I had made a Hyper-V guest SDK and a UEFI application SDK to make me happy and achieve my goals.
  \item I also had the experience for ROS (not ROS2) because I was a member of autonomous driving team when I was a college student.
\end{itemize}

In recent days, I have created a new project called [Mile.Milk](https://github.com/ProjectMile/Mile.Milk), provides 
some customized configurations for Linux Kernel, used in projects which were created by Kenji Mouri.

Note: Milk is the abbreviation of Mouri Internal Linux Kernel.

## Why create it

I want to create a cloud-friendly and lightweight Linux distro for microservices base on .NET.

So, I need a customized Linux Kernel to achieve the goal.

## How to use

Copy the configuration file you want to the root directory of Linux Kernel source code, and rename to `.config`.

## Afterword

I hope you will enjoy it. Thanks for reading.

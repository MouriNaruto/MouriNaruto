Since maintaining open-source projects only for love is not sustainable, I hope
to find a way to keep my passion for maintaining open-source projects. So, I am
proud to introduce my Patreon-based sponsor service, I think it is a good way 
to achieve this goal.

Here is my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/MouriNaruto

There are three levels which can be chosen in my Patreon page.

### Faithful Supporter ($1 per month)

This option is suitable for people who want to support me only. I am happy I 
can have a good cup of coffee from you. You can send me a message and I would
respond! Thank you for doing this!

### Exclusive Projects Available ($5 per month)

I will provide several projects only available for sponsors to you. In the
current stage, I start to provide Shadow Maiden, it is a system optimization 
tool for Windows. This is my first project which follow the sponsorware model.
The first release of Shadow Maiden, or 1.0 (Build 2) and it's now available.

### Customized Projects Available ($3000 per month)

Important Note: I know this level is really expensive, I set that because I
need to set a price which is higher than my monthly salary which can make me
help you without any worries. If you really want to choose this level, please
contact me immediately via e-mail first before sponsoring.

I can customize and develop projects exclusive for you if you choose this. If
you are a company, sincerely I hope we can set up a long-term cooperation 
relationship in the future.

## Afterwards

I really hope I can find a sustainable way to keep my passion for maintaining
open-source projects. Thank you for reading.

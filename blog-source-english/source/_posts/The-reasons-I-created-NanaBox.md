[NanaBox](https://github.com/M2Team/NanaBox) maybe the first open-source third-party lightweight XAML-based
out-of-box-experience oriented Hyper-V client based on Host Compute System API, Remote Desktop ActiveX control
and XAML Islands.

But maybe you will ask me the reasons I created NanaBox, I will tell you in this article.

## Create a virtual machine software for personal use

Because the recent version of VMware Workstation has several issues which are not fixed after waiting at least half a
year. So, I think I should make a virtualization solution for myself, and it will be easier for me to do something I 
want because its implementation is controlled.

## Developing projects based on Hyper-V

Because Host Compute System API is only support Hyper-V Gen 2 Virtual Machine which is a typical UEFI Class 3 platform.
I can use it for designing, developing. debugging and test some UEFI applications.

Also, Hyper-V is a typical paravirtualization solution which can use in large scale production environments. So I can
discover some ultra-lightweight solutions which can utilize the paravirtualization.

Since the success of NanaZip and replace NSudo as my representative project. I think it's time to create and rename 
some projects with the Nana prefix.

## The reason of use Nana prefix

- Conform to the convention that most of M2-Team projects created by myself start with the N letter.
- Unify the product line from M2-Team created by myself.
- There are some connections between Nana and my real name. Kenji Mouri is only my pseudonym and Japanese name.

## The list of Nana Series Projects

P.S. Sort by project release date.

Hi there, I go by Kenji Mouri. Typical usernames include *Mouri_Naruto* or
*Mouri*, interested in writing the most compact implementations by using
the least syntaxes and third-party libraries, and love creating open-source
projects and sometimes making contributions for other's. I am also a 
[Microsoft MVP] and a [PCBeta moderator]. Here is my [blog] and [resume].

## Sponsor Service

Since maintaining open-source projects only for love is not sustainable, I hope
to find a way to keep my passion for maintaining open-source projects. So, I am
proud to introduce my Patreon-based sponsor service, I think it is a good way 
to achieve this goal.

Here is my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/MouriNaruto

There are three levels which can be chosen in my Patreon page.

- **Faithful Supporter ($1 per month):** This option is suitable for people
  who want to support me only. I am happy I can have a good cup of coffee from
  you. You can send me a message and I would respond! Thank you for doing this!
- **Exclusive Projects Available ($5 per month):** I will provide several
  projects only available for sponsors to you. In the current stage, I start to
  provide Shadow Maiden, it is a system optimization tool for Windows. This is
  my first project which follow the sponsorware model. The first release of
  Shadow Maiden, or 1.0 (Build 2) and it's now available.
- **Customized Projects Available ($3000 per month):** I can customize and
  develop projects exclusive for you if you choose this. If you are a company,
  sincerely I hope we can set up a long-term cooperation relationship in the
  future. (Important Note: I know this level is really expensive, I set that
  because I am busy and I need to set a price which is higher than my monthly
  salary which can make me help you without any worries. **If you really want
  to choose this level, please contact me immediately via e-mail first before
  sponsoring.**) 

Note: If you don't want to use Patreon, I also provide the alternative option
based on PayPal, maybe it's a suitable way.

Hi there,

You can call me Kenji Mouri (毛利 研二) or Mouri (毛利) in most cases. You also
can call me Kuriko Mou (毛 栗子) when I'm in [VTuber] or [Otokonoko] mode.

[Otokonoko]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otokonoko

*MouriNaruto*, *Mouri_Naruto* and *Mouri* are my typical usernames.

I am interested in writing the most compact implementations by using the least
syntaxes and third-party libraries, and love creating open-source projects and
sometimes making contributions for other's. I am also a [Microsoft MVP] and a
[PCBeta moderator]. Here is my [blog], [resume], [technical speeches] and 
[technical documentations].

## Sponsor Service

Since maintaining open-source projects only for love is not sustainable, I hope
to find a way to keep my passion for maintaining open-source projects. So, I am
proud to introduce my Patreon and Afdian (爱发电) based sponsor service, I think
it is a good way to achieve this goal.

- Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/MouriNaruto
- Afdian (爱发电) page: https://afdian.net/a/MouriNaruto

Note: If you don't want to use Patreon, I also provide the alternative option
based on PayPal, maybe it's a suitable way.

Here is my PayPal.me page: https://paypal.me/MouriNaruto

Here is [the list of people who had sponsored me](Sponsors.md).

Hi there,

You can call me Kenji Mouri (毛利 研二) or Mouri (毛利) in most cases. You also
can call me Kuriko Mou (毛 栗子) when I'm in [VTuber] or [Otokonoko] mode.

*MouriNaruto*, *Mouri_Naruto* and *Mouri* are my typical usernames.

I am interested in writing the most compact implementations by using the least
syntaxes and third-party libraries, and love creating open-source projects and
sometimes making contributions for other's. I am also a [Microsoft MVP] and a
[PCBeta moderator]. Here is my [blog], [resume], [projects], [speeches] and 
[documentations].

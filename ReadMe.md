Hi there, I go by Kenji Mouri. Typical usernames include `Mouri_Naruto` or
`Mouri`, interested in writing the most compact implementations by using
the least syntaxes and third-party libraries, and love creating open-source
projects and sometimes making contributions for other's. I am also a 
[Microsoft MVP] and a [PCBeta moderator]. Here is my [blog] and [resume].

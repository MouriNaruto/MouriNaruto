Hi there,

My public name is Kenji Mouri, or 毛利 研二 in Japanese. In China, due to my
public name, my friends call me 毛利, or Mouri in English. In some cases, my
friends also call me Kuriko Mou, or 毛 栗子 in Japanese. But my legal name is
卢起, or Qi Lu in English. Maybe you will see this name in the certificates
which used in projects maintained by me in the future.

*MouriNaruto*, *Mouri_Naruto* and *Mouri* are my typical usernames.

I am interested in writing the most compact implementations by using the least
syntaxes and third-party libraries, and love creating open-source projects and
sometimes making contributions for other's. I am also a [Microsoft MVP] and a
[PCBeta moderator]. Here is my [blog], [resume], [projects], [speeches] and 
[documentations]. If you want to sponsor me, please read
[Become a sponsor to Kenji Mouri](Sponsor).

## Things I currently working on

Due to many people have asked me why not update a specific project frequently.
I think I should provide you the list of things I currently working on will be
the best explanation. This list will be sorted in priority order.

Here are the things I want to have progress in December 2023. The [archive] is
available if you want to read the history of this list.

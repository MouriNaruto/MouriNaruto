Hi there,

My public name is Kenji Mouri, or 毛利 研二 in Japanese. In China, due to my
public name, my friends call me 毛利, or Mouri in English. In some cases, my
friends also call me Kuriko Mou, or 毛 栗子 in Japanese.

*MouriNaruto*, *Mouri_Naruto* and *Mouri* are my typical usernames.

I am passionate about developing highly efficient software implementations with
minimal syntax and reliance on third-party libraries, and love creating
open-source projects and sometimes making contributions for other's. I am also
a [Microsoft MVP] and a [PCBeta moderator]. Here is my [blog], [resume],
[projects], [speeches] and [documentations]. If you want to sponsor me, please
read [Become a sponsor to Kenji Mouri](Sponsor).

Also, I have provided several [paid services](PaidServices.md) from me.

## Things I currently working on

Due to many people have asked me why not update a specific project frequently.
I think I should provide you the list of things I currently working on will be
the best explanation. This list will be sorted in priority order.

Here are the things I want to have progress in 2025. The [archive] is
available if you want to read the history of this list.

#### Porting Hyper-V Enhanced Session mode over VMBus to Hyper-V Linux guests.

Status: Working In Progress

Current I have made a implementation at https://github.com/SherryPlatform/HvGin.

But there are some stability issues which need to fix. If people can help me
will be good.

#### NanaZip 5.x

Status: Working In Progress

Currently, the released NanaZip 5.0 has implemented the UFS/UFS2 support.

I also implemented the .NET Single File Application bundle and Electron Archive
(asar) support in the main branch.

Also, LittleFS and ROMFS are also planned to implement in NanaZip 5.x.

Also, I think we should use more algorithm implementations from Windows APIs,
which is "As Microsoft As Possible" a.k.a. AMAP strategy which mentioned by me.

AMAP strategy can help me to reduce the attack surface and the binary size.

#### Mobility

Status: Working In Progress

I hope I can write a prototype implementation of that.

NanaZip 5.x's planned features will be helpful for development.

#### Switch to FreeBSD

Status: Working In Progress

I hope I can switch to FreeBSD as my development platform because its license is
suitable for me to customize the system.

Currently I started to use FreeBSD. But there are some issues need to solve
before I drop Linux.

#### My first technical book

Status: Working In Progress

I decided to write a technical book about the Hyper-V guest interfaces.

I start to write the book this year in English.

I need to continue to maintain and create related open-source projects as the
examples mentioned in the book.

#### Sherry Platform

Status: Working In Progress

Vermouth had said that "a secret makes a woman woman".

Project Edogawa is a planned file manager for Linux-based Sherry Platform which
shares the codec from NanaZip.

So, this project is also called "Sherry Platform's Project Edogawa" a.k.a. SPEC.

#### Make Wayland Great Again

Status: Working In Progress

I think I need to make an immersive Wayland compositor for X11 which can help
resource-constraint devices.

Hi there,

Due to I have two identities because I have planned dual personas when I created
my current GitHub ID called *MouriNaruto* in 2012: Kenji Mouri (毛利研二) for
he/his identity and Kuriko Mou (毛栗子) for she/her identity. You can choose the
mode you think is OK.

*MouriNaruto*, *Mouri_Naruto* and *Mouri* are my typical usernames.

I am interested in writing the most compact implementations by using the least
syntaxes and third-party libraries, and love creating open-source projects and
sometimes making contributions for other's. I am also a [Microsoft MVP] and a
[PCBeta moderator]. Here is my [blog], [resume], [technical speeches] and 
[technical documentations].

## Sponsor Service

Since maintaining open-source projects only for love is not sustainable, I hope
to find a way to keep my passion for maintaining open-source projects. So, I am
proud to introduce my Patreon and afdian based sponsor service, I think it is a good way 
to achieve this goal.

- Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/MouriNaruto
- afdian page: https://afdian.net/a/MouriNaruto

Note: If you don't want to use Patreon, I also provide the alternative option
based on PayPal, maybe it's a suitable way.

Here is my PayPal.me page: https://paypal.me/MouriNaruto

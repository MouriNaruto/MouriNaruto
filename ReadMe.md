Hi there,

My public name is Kenji Mouri, or 毛利 研二 in Japanese. In China, due to my
public name, my friends call me 毛利, or Mouri in English. In some cases, my
friends also call me Kuriko Mou, or 毛 栗子 in Japanese. But my legal name is
卢起, or Qi Lu in English. Maybe you will see this name in the certificates
which used in projects maintained by me in the future.

*MouriNaruto*, *Mouri_Naruto* and *Mouri* are my typical usernames.

I am interested in writing the most compact implementations by using the least
syntaxes and third-party libraries, and love creating open-source projects and
sometimes making contributions for other's. I am also a [Microsoft MVP] and a
[PCBeta moderator]. Here is my [blog], [resume], [projects], [speeches] and 
[documentations]. If you want to sponsor me, please read
[Become a sponsor to Kenji Mouri](Sponsor).

Also, I have provided several [paid services](PaidServices.md) from me.

## Things I currently working on

Due to many people have asked me why not update a specific project frequently.
I think I should provide you the list of things I currently working on will be
the best explanation. This list will be sorted in priority order.

Here are the things I want to have progress in January 2024. The [archive] is
available if you want to read the history of this list.

#### NanaZip 3.0 Preview 1

Status: Working In Progress

The split progress of NanaZip and NanaZip Classic is finished.

Just working on making NanaZip more XAML based UI.

#### Porting Hyper-V Enhanced Session mode over VMBus to Hyper-V Linux guests.

Status: Working In Progress

I think I should write a generic VMBus pipe user mode access driver for Linux.
It's a better way to introduce more possibilities.

#### Implement the new Windows backend for LVGL. (Early December 2023)

Status: Working In Progress

I hope I can finish the LVGL display creation abstraction and push the 
implementation to the mainline.

#### Sherry Platform

Status: Working In Progress

Vermouth had said that "a secret makes a woman woman".

Project Edogawa is a planned file manager for Linux-based Sherry Platform which
shares the codec from NanaZip.
